    #SCENE1


        "..." " [mc] gets teleported to a street in Manila noticing the different scenery and ambiance"
        "..." " [mc] sees 5 people storming out of a building one of which  [mc] remembers to be Manuel Quezon"
        "..." "shortly after storming out of the building Manuel Quezon separates from the group so [mc] decides to follow the other 4 people who seem to be walking towards an alley-way. Along the way the [mc] listens in to the 4 people gossiping"

        mc "(Looking around) Teka, nasaan ako? Ibang-iba to sa lugar kung saan ako nung una. (Spots Manuel Quezon and the group) Teka, hindi ba si Manuel Quezon yan? Dapat ko silang sundan"

        ManuelQuezon "(Storming out of the building) Hindi ako makapaniwala dito! Isa na namang desisyon na pabor sa mga Amerikano kaysa sa mga kapwa pilipino"

        MC "(Following the group) Mukhang galit sila sa isang bagay. Malapitan nga para malaman ko kung ano ang pinag-uusapan nila"

        "..." "Filipino Leaders are corrupt and that they are upset about the recent appointment of Gen. Wood"

        Person1 "(Gossiping) Nabalitaan niyo? Sinasabi nila na corrupt ang mga pilipino!"

        Person2 "(Nodding) At ngayon itinalaga nila si General Wood."

        mc "(Listening intently) General Wood? Hindi ba siya yung  American gobernador-heneral?"

        "..." "(Chatter of multiple people discussing the \"anti-filipino\" report from Gen. Wood administration.)"

        Person3 "(Joining the group) Nakita niyo ba ang bagong balita? Pinipinta tayo ng administrasyon ni Wood bilang anti-Filipino!"

        "..." "[mc] vividly remembering about Gen. Wood being an American governor-general and concludes that he is now in the American Era."

        mc "(Thinking)Ahh, ito pala ang panahon ng mga amerikano sa pilipinas."

        Speaker "(Rising to speak) Mga kapwa ko Pilipino, hindi tayo maaaring manatiling nakatingin lang habang patuloy na inaapi ni Heneral Wood ang ating bayan! Panahon na para tayo ay magkaisa at labanan ang kawalang-katarungang ito nang buong lakas!"

        mc "(Realizing the gravity of the situation) Paghihimagsik? Seryoso ito."

        mc "(Continuing to explore Manila) Ganito pala ang maynila sa panahon ng mga amerikano. Ibang-iba sa nakasanayan ko."
    
    
        #Scene 2
        "..." "the next day,[mc] goes to the same alley-way surprised to see that the number of people have doubled and that it had more important looking people."

        " [mc] (Inner monologue)"" hmmm… Sa sino sino kaya ang mga importanteng tao sa mga iyon? Siguro puro sila mga politiko…"

        "..." "It seemed that the Filipinos at the time decided to create a petition letter to address their grievances against Governor-General Leonard Wood. The person writing the letter reads aloud as they write the letter."
        Person4 "The first twenty years of civil government were marked by mutual understanding and loyal cooperation between American and Filipinos. At the end of that period, when it seemed that the goal had finally been reached, after the President of the United States had advised the Congress that the time had come for America to fulfill [sub_pronoun2] sacred pledge. Major-General Leonard Wood was sent to the Philippines as Governor-General, Cognizant of the part taken by General Wood in the liberation of Cuba, the Filipino people expected that under [sub_pronoun1] administration the spirit of cooperation would be maintained and that the work of political emancipation would be complete. Contrary, however, to our expectations, [sub_pronoun1] conduct of government has been characterized by a train of usurpations and arbitrary acts, resulting in the curtailment of our autonomy. the destruction of our constitutional system, and the reversal of America's Philippine policy."
        
        " [mc] wonders for a bit and connects the pieces of the puzzle"

        mc "So ganun pala ang nangyari… lahat ng Filipino leaders ay galit kay general Wood sa kadahilanang, naibunyag nya ang mga corruption ng mga filipino leaders habang siya ay namamahala bilang governor-general. Ang corruption na galing sa mga filipino leaders ay isang paghahanda para sa Philippine Independence; pinalalawak nila ang kanilang kapangyarihan upang pagdating ng panahon ang pilipinas ay maging malaya pero sila ang mamamahala dito."
        
        "...""After [mc] inner monologue he suddenly gets teleported and while within the time machine rift he realizes:"

        mc "(Inner monologue) Ngayon ko lang na realize na nasa American Era of Philippine History pala ako…"

    #(CIA Intelligence Memorandum)
    #Scene1

    "..." "[mc] gets teleported in a dimly lit room where [mc] sees people in black suits having a meeting seated at a long rectangular table, then looks around to realize that there are guards around the room and that [mc] outfit is similar to that of a guard."

    mc "(Looks around the place) Nasaan ako ngayon?. Parang may nagme-meeting na mga tao dito. Halos magkaparehas ba naman suot ko ng mga guwardiya dito."

    "..." "[mc] Looks up to the door and sees the logo of the CIA."

    mc " Parang nasa building ata ako ng CIA. Makinig kaya ako ano pinag-uusapan nila."

    "..." "[mc] stands at the corner of a room acting as a guard."
    "..." "The meeting commences as a CIA executive opens with a stern tone."

    CIAExecutive "Gentlemen, we are gathered today to discuss a matter of national security. The spread of communism in Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines, poses a significant threat to American interests. To that end, we've compiled a report - CIA Memorandum 296 - detailing the current situation in the Philippines. "

    mc "Nagsabi siya tungkol sa kumonismo? Kasabit ata ang Soviet Union dito. Pero saang bandang era kaya ako napadpad?"

    CIAExecutive "The Philippines, currently under President Quirino's administration, is plagued by corruption, political instability, and economic decline. This creates a breeding ground for communist influence. While our analysis suggests the next Philippine president will likely be a supporter of the US, the current downward spiral could lead to a communist takeover."
    
    "..." "CIA Executive divides the memorandum into three parts: Political, Economical, and Military Situation."

    CIAExecutive "Memorandum 296 is divided into three sections: Political, Economic, and Military. Let's begin with the political situation. The Filipino people are deeply dissatisfied with the Quirino administration. Corruption scandals have eroded public trust. Not only politicians, but wealthy landowners and those in power are lining their pockets."
   
    CIAExecutive "Now, the economic situation. The Philippines, a rich agricultural nation, should be self-sufficient in food production. However, long-standing inequalities in land ownership have fueled the rise of communist movements, particularly the Huks in Luzon, which are now spreading across the archipelago."

    CIAExecutive " The government's attempt to bolster the economy by raising taxes and restricting foreign trade backfired. Filipinos fear for their economic future, further deepening the political and economic instability. This inefficiency and corruption stem from a lack of education and political immaturity."
   
    CIAExecutive "The military situation is no better. Since the Cold War began, the Philippines has faced communist resistance from the Hukbalahap, or Huks. The overall instability weakens the Philippine Constabulary and Armed Forces, rendering them incapable of maintaining order."
    

    mc "(Realizes) Nasa panahon pala ako ng Cold War, pagkatapos ng Ikalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig. Medyo intense pa ang issue nito."

    CIAExecutive "The Huks were originally anti-Japanese militants who later embraced communism. They're a rapidly growing guerilla force, well-equipped and supported by sympathetic villagers. Despite having better weapons, the Philippine military lacks strong leadership and motivation, making them ineffective against the Huks."
    
    mc "matagal na nakabaon ang korapsyon sa Pilipinas. Yan ay sanhi ng maraming problemang nangyari dito sa bansang ito."

    CIAExecutive "The agenda for this meeting has been already addressed and that no further discussion will occur. You are all dismissed."

    "..." "As the meeting ends, one guard notices [mc] presence and realizes they were not supposed to be there and was supposed to be assigned to a different room, prompting [mc] to flee."

    mc " (Realizing) Hala!! Nakita niya ako. Kailangan ko nang umalis dito!"

    "[mc] runs towards the door and exits to another room. Just before the guard catches up, they are transported back to the time machine rift where they're nowhere to be seen."
