        "..." "After declining the machine’s offer to see what happened to Magellan the [mc] gets teleported to a town in Manila during the early Spanish colonization. He roamed around observing the place and the traditions present during the time."

        mc "The architecture, the atmosphere... It's like stepping into a history book."

        "..." "[mc] continued strolling through the streets, taking in the sights and sounds of the unfamiliar place." 
        
        "..." "As he wanders, he notices a man standing near the town square, his gaze fixed intently on the bustling activity around him."
        
        "..." "Intrigued by the man's focused observation, [mc] decides to approach and strike up a conversation."

        mc "Hi there. I couldn’t help but notice you observing the people around here. Are you studying the people here?"

        juanDePlasencia "(Looking up with a surprised, but friendly smile) Oh, hello! Yes, I am, in a way. I'm Juan De Plascensia, a friar. And you are?"

        "[mc] (Inner Voice)" "That name sounds familiar, but I can't quite place it. Where have I heard it before?"

        mc "I'm [mc]. I travel around, trying to get a feel for each place. What exactly are you observing father Plasencia?"

        juanDePlasencia "You seemed interested in what I do. Would you like to accompany me? This could be a great lesson for you."

        mc "Definitely, I'd like to father Plascencia."

        juanDePlasencia "I am honestly concerned with the welfare of Filipinos, spaniards limit the things the filipino can learn that aside from christian doctrine, reading and writing should also be taught to filipinos."

        mc "That's an important point, father plasencia, education is key to empowerment. It's through knowledge and understanding that people can truly thrive. Limiting education limits potential."

        juanDePlasencia "That's right I learned this in the process of compiling the Customs, I obtained the simple truth in government, administration of justice, inheritances, slaves, and dowries."

        "..." "Juan De Plasencia and [mc] are strolling through the outskirts of a bustling town, their conversation interspersed with occasional pauses as they take in the sights."

        juanDePlasencia "Look ahead, do you see those figures in the distance, dressed in lavish clothing and carrying themselves with confidence?"
    
        mc "Ah, yes father Plasencia. They stand out amidst the backdrop of the town, like majestic pillars amidst a sea of common folk. Are they the nobles?"
    
        juanDePlasencia "Precisely. Those are the maharlika, the noble class of society. From afar, one can almost feel the weight of their influence."
    
        mc "And beneath their lofty stature lies...?"

        juanDePlasencia "A grim reality, I'm afraid. Beneath them are the commoners, the aliping namamahay, whose lives are intertwined with serving their noble masters."
    
        mc "It's as if a veil of privilege separates them from the rest of society."

        juanDePlasencia "Indeed, and let us not forget those who dwell at the very bottom of this hierarchy—the slaves, the aliping guiguilir, condemned to a life of servitude and hardship."

        mc "As we witness this scene unfold before us, it shows the injustices of the Filipino experience."

        #Scene 2
    
        juanDePlasencia "As we walk through these streets, let me share another fascinating aspect of The town. Disputes, my friend, were settled with a certain degree of communal wisdom. "
    
        mc "How so? "

        juanDePlasencia "Well, imagine this: when conflicts arose, it wasn't just left to the whims of the powerful."

        juanDePlasencia "Investigations and sentences were passed by the dato, but always in the presence of the community members from his barangay."
   
        mc "So, transparency was valued?"
   
        juanDePlasencia "Indeed. And if any party felt unjustly treated, they had recourse. An arbiter, chosen unanimously, would preside over the proceedings."

        juanDePlasencia "Interestingly, this arbiter need not necessarily be a dato; they were selected based on their reputation for fairness and justice."

        mc "It's a system that emphasizes community involvement and consensus."

        juanDePlasencia "Precisely. Even in cases involving chiefs or disputes between barangays, they would convene judges as arbiters to prevent escalation into war."
    
        juanDePlasencia "And there was a curious custom: in these ceremonies, all parties had to drink together, with the plaintiff extending the invitation."

        mc "A symbolic gesture of reconciliation, perhaps?"

        juanDePlasencia "Indeed, it speaks volumes about their customs and the importance they placed on maintaining harmony within their communities."
    
        #Scene 3

        "" "(Plasencia and [mc] stroll along at a leisurely pace as the sun sets, creating lengthy shadows. They arrive upon a magnificent church tucked away among the charming town surroundings as they turn a corner.)"

        juanDePlasencia "Look ahead, do you see that grand structure with its towering spire?"
        
        mc "Yes, it's quite striking against the backdrop of the town. What significance does it hold, father Plasencia?"

        juanDePlasencia "Ah, that church serves as a focal point for the community, a bastion of faith amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life."

        mc "How interesting. It must play a significant role in the lives of the people here."

        juanDePlasencia "Indeed, it does. But what's equally fascinating is the contrast it presents to the elaborate belief system of the Filipinos."

        mc "Elaborate belief system?"

        juanDePlasencia "Yes, indeed. You see, unlike the grand temples we might expect, the Filipinos had a rather unique approach to worship."

        mc "I'm intrigued. Please, do tell my father Plasencia."

        juanDePlasencia "Well, you see, they had what they called \"simbahan,\" or temples, but these weren't consecrated to sacrifices or idol worship as one might assume."

        mc "Really? Then what were they used for by Father Plasencia?"

        juanDePlasencia "hese temples were actually large houses of chiefs where festivals were celebrated."

        mc "The Filipinos would gather for worship, known as \"nagaanitos,\" honoring their idols like Badhala, whom they revered as \"all-powerful\" or \"maker of all things\"."

        mc "That's fascinating, tying their worship to the communal gatherings."
    
        juanDePlasencia "Indeed. It's a testament to the intricacies of their belief system, which also encompassed reverence for nature and a complex understanding of the afterlife."

        #Scene 4

        juanDePlasencia "You know, my friend, I must admit, I'm truly grateful for this opportunity to explore and discuss the customs and traditions of Tagalog with you."

        mc "The pleasure is mine, father Plasencia. It's been enlightening to delve into the rich tapestry of their culture alongside you."

        juanDePlasencia "Indeed, it has been a journey filled with discovery and understanding."

        juanDePlasencia "And as we stand here, contemplating the complexities of their beliefs and practices, I can't help but feel a sense of purpose stirring within me."

        mc "What do you mean?"

        juanDePlasencia "Well, you see, I've long harbored a desire to evangelize and bring the light of Christianity to the Tagalog people."

        juanDePlasencia "And now, as I stand on the precipice of this endeavor, I realize the importance of documenting their customs and traditions."

        mc "Documenting?"

        juanDePlasencia "Yes. I intend to write a narrative, a comprehensive account of the customs and traditions of Tagalog, shedding light on their beliefs, their rituals, and their way of life. "

        juanDePlasencia "Through this narrative, I hope to not only preserve their culture but also lay the groundwork for our evangelization efforts."

        mc "That's a noble undertaking, father Plasencia. I have no doubt that your narrative will serve as a valuable resource in bridging the gap between our worlds."
 
        juanDePlasencia "Thank you, your words are a source of encouragement. Let us continue to learn and grow together, perhaps we'll meet again to share more insights and discoveries."

        mc "Indeed, father Plasencia. Until then, safe travels and may our paths cross again in the future."

        #Scene 5

        mc "Father Plasencia... where have I heard that name before? Ah, yes, in my history class. He's the one who wrote that narrative on the customs of Tagalog."

        mc " It's surreal to think that I've just met someone whose work I've studied. His insights have been invaluable in understanding some complexities of Tagalog society. "

        "[mc] (Inner Voice)" "hmm..Father Plasencia's work was quite the undertaking, commissioned by the Spanish government to unravel the socio-political structure of the Tagalogs. It's fascinating how the Spanish perceived it as weak and segmented, contrasting with their own system."

        "[mc] (Inner Voice)" "His narrative delved into various facets of Tagalog life, from marriage customs to spiritual beliefs. I recall his observations on enslavement due to unpaid debts, a practice viewed through a European lens."

        "[mc] (Inner Voice)" "He noted their reverence for stars and spiritual practitioners, albeit labeling them as \"priests of the devil.\" Yet, amidst these misconceptions, he acknowledged their belief in Badhala and an afterlife."

        "[mc] (Inner Voice)" "Plasencia's narrative offers glimpses into Tagalog culture, but it's essential to remember its limitations, especially when intertwined with Catholic beliefs during Spanish rule."

        "[mc] (Inner Voice)" "His concept of the \"barangay,\" though misunderstood, became entrenched in Filipino political discourse, perpetuating misunderstandings. Revisiting primary sources like Plasencia allows for a nuanced understanding of indigenous concepts"
        
        "[mc] (Inner Voice)" "It's crucial to recognize that Plasencia's work is but a fragment of pre-sixteenth century Philippine culture, leaving much more to explore and understand."
        
        "..." "[mc] starts to dissapear as he gets teleported"

        mc "Uhh.. What is this place? Hmm... I'm seeing lots of books here. I see, I'm in the library now."

        "..." "(A librarian walks up to him)"

        rizal "Maybe you're interested in this book."

        mc " May I know what it is about?"

        rizal "Hmm.. sure. This book is called \"Sucesos de las Islas\". It's about the documentation of events during the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines."

        rizal "Go ahead!"

        mc "What do you think about that book?"

        rizal "All I can say is that for me personally, this is a great and an impressive book to have, but.. there are still biases that are present in this book."
